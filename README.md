## Synopsis

This is a project I did as part of a pre-employment process for a company to which I applied. The challenge was to make a recreate the homepage of the provided website. The requirements are to use one of two perscribed themes, use the Advanced Custom Fields plugin, no hard-coded text, and the user should be able to dynamically change any content on the site.
